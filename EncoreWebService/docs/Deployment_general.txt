The document below explains how to build and deploy encore app webservices. 
Build is to be executed in local machine and war file needs to be deployed to AWS VM

Pre-setup for building the project
----------------------------------
1. Java
  a. Install Java from https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk8-binaries/releases/tag/jdk8u242-b08. Download based on OS and install Java
  b. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable to installed folder
  c. Update PATH enviroment variable to JAVA_HOME/bin (This would be set by installer, if not set please add it manually)
2. Maven
  a. Download https://mirror.olnevhost.net/pub/apache/maven/maven-3/3.8.1/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.1-bin.zip and extract to suitable folder
  b. Set MVN_HOME enviroment variable, to extracted folder
  c. Update PATH enviroment variable to MVN_HOME/bin

Build
-----
1. Checkout project from github (https://github.com/encoretimeapp/encoretime) to a suitable folder
2. cd to EncoreParentPOM
3. run command: mvn clean install
4. cd to parent folder(project checkout folder)
5. run command: mvn clean install 
6. After Step 5, the final built war file encore-webservice-2020.1-SNAPSHOT.jar will be available in EncoreWebService\target folder

Deployment
----------
1. Create suitable folder in VM
2. Copy encore war file to folder
3. Run java -jar [war name] 

Above deployment steps provide information for setting up fresh

AWS VM
------
-> In VM start.sh file starts webservice and is automatically invoked on system startup (sudo systemctl start/stop/status encoreapp)
-> EncoreWebService project folder has deploy.bat file, when run from EncoreWebService location, it deploys war from local machine to VM

-> Folder structure in AWS VM
-----------------------------
Folder path:/data/encoreapp
 |
 |-- certs (folder)
     |-- encore.keystore
 |-- application.properties
 |-- database.properties
 |-- encore-webservice-2020.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
 |-- log4j2.xml
 |-- logs (folder - will get automatically created if not present, application events are logged to this folder)
     |-- ... (log monthly folders)
	 |-- encoreapp.log
 |-- start.sh
 
-> Settings customizations
--------------------------
1. certs and encore.keystore - Deploy SSL certificates (Refer Deployig_SSL.txt)
2. application.properties - overrides default settings, if SSL changes update this file (runs webservice in port 8443)
3. database.properties - overrides default settings, update this if required to connect to different database/server
4. log4j2.xml - settings used for logging, no changes required except for debugging
5. start.sh - starts web service war file (added to systemctl with name encoreapp)
